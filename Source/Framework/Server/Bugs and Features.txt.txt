CAR 101: Server config doesn't allow user-defined ports
CAR 102: Measurement doesn't store result in private data
CAR 103: If progress bar 'X' is clicked before complete it is not shut down correctly
CAR 104: If an error occurs while progress bar is running, it does not have the ability to send a 'stop' command
CAR 105: Rapidly clicking 'start' / 'stop' will click another button as it moves (because stop button is moved temporarily to where it is)
